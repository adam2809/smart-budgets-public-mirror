### Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs concurrently `npm server` and `npm client` in order to start both ends of the application.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the front end in the browser.
The server runs on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) followed by some endpoint

The page will reload if you make edits to the React code.

_Work in progress_
